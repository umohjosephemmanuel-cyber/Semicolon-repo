              if(hoursWorked > Regularhourslimit) {
                 regular = regular hourslimit*hourlyrate;
                 double overtimehours = hoursWorked - regularhours limit;
                 totalpay = regularpay + overtimepay;
               } else {
                 totalpay = hoursworked*hourlyrate;
