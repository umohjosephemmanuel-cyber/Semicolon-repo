#  Question:What is wrong with this code.
#  a = b = 7
#  print('a =', a, '\nb =', b)


#  Answer
#  1. a = b = 7  This means you are using the variable of "7" for both "a" and "b".

#  2.  The "Print" functions as an outputs for both values.


#  3.  "\n" This means creating a line break.









a = b = 7
print('a =', a, '\nb =', b)
